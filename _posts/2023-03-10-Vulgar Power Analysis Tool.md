![Power Analysis](<img src="/assets/tsi-3.png"/>)

This chart is meant to function as a tool for developing a power analysis to understand relative strength within a world of material forces. This is not directed toward creating an all-encompassing analysis of every kind of power, rather, it is a rough way to help orient around power within a complex world.

At the center are the concepts of Power, Control, and Capacity. Freedom is in brackets beside Power because, for present purposes, Power is a necessary condition (or capacity) for Freedom. How we measure our Power is by evaluating our access to and our ability to control each of the three main components: **TIME**, **SPACE**, and **INFORMATION**. The three main components are the major dimensions of our physical world and are therefore the starting point for any accounting.
