<img class="profile-picture" src="{{site.baseurl}}/{{site.profile-picture}}">

I am an attorney and educator deeply interested in the complex dynamics that propagate between legal institutions and social movements in the context of periods (or eras) of crisis. Currently, I serve as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Law at [Penn State Dickinson Law](https://dickinsonlaw.psu.edu/abi-hassen), where I am currently teaching Professional Responsibility, Trial Advocacy, and "Law in Emergency," a seminar that delves into my research interests. Additionally, I am a partner at [O’Neill and Hassen LLP](http://oandh.net), a law firm dedicated to indigent criminal defense. I am also a former co-founder of the [Black Movement-Law Project](http://bmlp.org), a rapid legal response initiative that emerged in response to uprisings in places like Ferguson and Baltimore. Previously, I held the role of Mass Defense Coordinator at the National Lawyers Guild. My background also includes roles as a political campaign manager and strategist, a union and community organizer.

My research focuses on the interplay between race, technology, and legal institutions, alongside the practice and theory of social and political movements. I am committed to developing comprehensive insights that examine these topics from multiple angles, seeking to incorporate insights from political philosophy, legal theory, and history. My work aims to both challenge and understand the role of law as a tool for social change, while also considering its limitations, as I contribute to building effective organizations for societal transformation and exploring the landscape of political possibilities.
