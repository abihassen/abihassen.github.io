<img class="profile-picture" src="{{site.baseurl}}/{{site.profile-picture}}">

I am a political philosophy student, attorney, technologist, co-founder of [Black Movement-Law Project](http://bmlp.org), a legal support rapid response group that grew out of the uprisings in Ferguson, Baltimore, and elsewhere. I am currently a partner at [O’Neill and Hassen LLP](http://oandh.net), a law practice focused on indigent criminal defense. Prior to this current work, I was the Mass Defense Coordinator at the [National Lawyers Guild](http://nlg.org). I have also worked as a political campaign manager and strategist, union organizer, and community organizer.

I am particularly interested in exploring the nature and potentials of movement organizing and the interface of political organizations and social movements with other complex systems (e.g. the law, capitalism, racism, climate).

>
> — Barbara Fields

> The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best – and therefore never scrutinize or question._
>
> — Stephen Jay Gould
